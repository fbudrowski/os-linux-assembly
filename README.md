Assembly projects for University of Warsaw course

Here you can find tests for a 18/19 Operating Systems course at University of Warsaw. You are free to contribute - just make a pull request.

### Naming of solutions
Tests with a generator are in the `test` directory. For the `script.sh` testing script to work, you need to:
1. Copy your `attack.asm` file to `zad1` directory
2. Run `script.sh`.

Tests expecting exit code 0 should have a .0 suffix and those expecting exit code 1 should end with .1

### Future changes
I will make my solution to task 1 public soon after the **22 March** deadline.
